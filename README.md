# Home-SIEM-Lab

# Objective

This project showcases the deployment and configuration of a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using the Elastic Stack within a home lab environment. The primary objective was to simulate real-world security operations center (SOC) workflows by integrating endpoint telemetry, ingesting system and network logs, and leveraging Elastic Agent for scalable data collection.

A Kali Linux virtual machine was configured to simulate adversarial behavior using tools like Nmap, generating suspicious network activity and command-line executions. These events were forwarded to the Elastic SIEM for real-time log analysis, threat hunting, and event correlation.

The project emphasizes key blue team skills such as log ingestion pipelines, alert rule development, dashboard visualization, and incident detection and response reinforcing the principles of network monitoring, host-based intrusion detection (HIDS), and proactive threat identification in a modern SIEM ecosystem.
